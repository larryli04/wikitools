Fun things with the Wikipedia API

### Finding Philosophy

I do not know what these are nor what for. May use in the future
- wikirace.py
- build.py

start.py goes to the first page in a wikipedia article until it reaches philosophy.

newxml.py generates a json file with the links of the first page locally

There are SO MANY problems with this code. Good luck.

newxml.py builds a json from the xml
philosophy.py is an interactive script that looks for paths until you reach philosophy
graph.py generates a graphml file from the json
