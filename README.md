Fun things with the Wikipedia API

### Finding Philosophy

I do not know what these are nor what for. May use in the future
- wikirace.py
- build.py

start.py goes to the first page in a wikipedia article until it reaches philosophy.

TODO:
- map out wikipedia (dynamic programming)
- convert to local accessing
- make sure loops are detected

Date pages currently not supported because they rely on templates
